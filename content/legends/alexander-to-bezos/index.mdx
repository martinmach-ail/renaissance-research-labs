hook: "In 334 BCE, a twenty-two-year-old in debt crossed into Asia with a thirty-day food supply and a war chest he had already given away. His generals took equity in his hopes. Twenty-three centuries later, Jeff Bezos built Amazon on infrastructure other people paid for, then became infrastructure himself. Between those two moments, every empire that outlasted its founder solved the same problem: how to replace the genius with a system. This volume maps the architecture of scaling across three thousand years of evidence, from Roman flat-pack galleys to Walmart satellites to Costco's sacred chicken, and names the seven structural failure modes that no amount of process documentation has ever prevented."
