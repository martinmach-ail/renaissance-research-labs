hook: "A twenty-two-year-old meteorologist in the Army Air Corps discovered that he could save more pilots by identifying two weather conditions that kill than by trying to predict which conditions are safe. He spent the next sixty years applying that asymmetry to every domain he touched—and lost $5.4 million the one time he forgot his own lesson. This volume traces the logic of strategic refusal across military commanders, retail operators, semiconductor founders, and insurance executives, and examines the line where discipline becomes dogma and refusal becomes ruin."
