# SHORT punchy hook - high IQ writing style
hook: "The same obsessive focus that let Ford see what no one else could see made him blind to what everyone else could see. His story is the purest case study we have of how a founder's greatest strength becomes their characteristic weakness—and why the traits that create success and sustain it are rarely the same traits."

centralQuestion: "Why did the same traits that enabled Ford's revolutionary success also produce his catastrophic failures?"

    title: "The Paradox of Perfect Focus"
    hook: "Ford doubled wages when competitors called it suicide, then published propaganda that Hitler praised. The $5 Day and the Dearborn Independent came from the same mind. This volume traces the philosophy Ford developed before success validated it—and the blind spots it created."
    quote: "Money doesn't do me any good. I can't spend it on myself. Money has no value, anyway. It is merely a transmitter, like electricity."

    hook: "The moving assembly line was also a maiming line. Highland Park workers lost sixteen fingers per month on punch presses alone—and were paid extraordinarily well for the privilege.

    title: "The Succession Crisis"
    hook: "Ford fought five wars and won most of them. But each victory created conditions for the next defeat. The methods that broke the Selden patent cartel failed against Sloan's GM. The certainty that built the Model T prevented its replacement. By 1945, the most valuable manufacturing enterprise in the world was losing $10 million monthly—and the federal government was considering nationalization."

The central question of Ford's career is not how he succeeded—that part is well documented. The question is why the same mind that revolutionized manufacturing also published propaganda that Hitler praised, resisted unionization with violence, and nearly destroyed his own company by refusing to adapt. Ford's triumphs and failures came from the same trait applied to different domains. Each victory created conditions for the next defeat.
